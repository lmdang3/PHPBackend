# PHPBackend
Just a testing environment for me to play with php and Laravel framework. Going to make simples requests and test them as a pre-requisite for my future project. Will also use this opportunity to understand php composer and Apache webserver.

# How to run
open two terminals
cd vptest

terminal 1: npm run dev
terminal 2: php artisan serve
